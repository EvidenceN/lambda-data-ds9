- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

  An important part of code reviews is making sure the code works like it is supposed to. 
  Another important part of code reviews is checking to see if the code has comments to easily inform the user the purpose and functionality of the code. 

 - We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

  Containers allows us to download different versions of the same packages just for a particular project. It helps to keep projects and their packages, modules, and specifications separate to avoid version conflict and other conflicts that could occur.
